This is PlaceMark_Core part of my project.
I have decided to create an app that has placeMarks of 
interest that users can update places unusual 
animals have been spotted along with scenic areas.

In this version I have updated visuals further using bulma.
In this version Users can change there credentials. 
Add Lat and Long into there placeMark of interest Table. 
This version is currently using Json to store user and place/placeMark info.
This version consists of Welcome Page,Login page,Sign Up Page,About page, dashboard page and Edit User page.
You can Sign up and log in Add Species Category and Delete Species Category <br>
when inside the Species Category you can add Species spotted a bit of info about the species and the lat and lng at which it was spotted.<br>
This then shows up on a table that can be read you have the option to delete entries as well.
I currently have a leaflet map displayed on this page I haven't had a chance to make it work yet as<br>
I would like to get as much functionality working as I can and will see if I get a chance to actually get the pinpoint to work.
