Section 1 - Baseline Branch

1. I have covered basic Log in and sign up, add placeMark name
used Basic Api, Mem Model and localhost as my deployment.

Section 2 - Place_Core Branch

2. This is PlaceMark_Core part of my project.
I have decided to create an app that has placeMarks of 
interest that users can update places unusual 
animals have been spotted along with scenic areas.
In this version I have updated visuals further using bulma.
In this version Users can change there credentials. 
Add Latitude and Longitude into there placeMark of interest Table. 
This version is currently using Json to store user and place/placeMark info.
This version consists of Welcome Page,Login page,Sign Up Page,About page, dashboard page and Edit User page.
You can : <br>1. Sign up <br>2. log in <br>3. Add Species Category <br>4. Delete Species Category <br>
When inside the Species Category you can add Species spotted a bit of info about the species and the lat and lng at which it was spotted.
This then shows up on a table that can be read you have the option to delete entries as well.
I currently have a leaflet map displayed on this page I haven't had a chance to make it work yet as
I would like to get as much functionality working as I can and will see if I get a chance to actually get the pinpoint to work.
I have used glitch to deploy this particular version.

Section 3 - PlaceMark_Enhanced Branch

3. PlaceMark_Enhanced
In this version I have added an Admin Dashboard and seeded both admin and categories that can not be deleted.
I have used if and else statements in my hbs to make necessary buttons appear where you can 
delete and can't delete a category. I added the edit options on placeMarks inside my categories I have used Swagger Api.
I have also corrected a bug I found. I thought my methods were working perfectly 
when I realised a regular logged-in user if they typed the extension /admin in the browser could get to the admin
dashboard and potentially delete all users in the db. I have selected Homer Simpson as my Admin.
In this version I have switched from using json to mongo. I have also used my Deployment to cloud atlas to make my db public.

4. Section 4 - PlaceMark_Community Branch
In this version I have included JWT and I did a very minimal analytics I would have done more if I had more time.
I have attempted images I have images uploading, but I have a bug/code needs more work, that I would like to work further on fixing. 
Currently I have created an onclick button, so I can target the image uploader. The image will upload, and I have another button that 
will allow you to view specific image, but I haven't gotten it to disappear when I want it to and not to show up with other images when other buttons are clicked.
I think I have covered Feature / Master branch on git. I have deployed to heroku also.

5. PlaceMark Version 2 PlaceMarkV2-baseline/placeMarkV2.1
This version I have tried to implement the use of Private POI's and Public POI's. 
I have created the option to review your own placemarks in the view/edit/share area of my application.
Review appears on the specific PlaceMark that has been selected and also appears on your main Noticeboard page.
I have developed a way to make your placeMark private to you. If you decide not to share your placemark will not be seen on the main Dashboard.
While creating these reviews you also have the option to rate your placemark with stars. I did a small amount of unit testing.
I ran into many obstacles that took me a lot of time to figure out which didnt leave me much time for features I would have liked to add and have the time for
all the excess testing. I hashed and salted the passwords as well.
